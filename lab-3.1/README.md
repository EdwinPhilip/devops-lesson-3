# Exercise 3.1 - Relaional Database

Create a relational database container and access the database.

### Step 1

Open the Cloud Platform Console at https://console.cloud.google.com. Go to Compute Engine and VM Instances.
Start the VM if it isnâ€™t running and connect using SSH.

### Step 2

NEED TO CLONE THE REPO AS IT HAS TEST DATA - TEST THIS AND THE REST OF THE STEPS

Clone the repository for lesson 3 and change to the lab directory.

`git clone https://github.com/simplilearn-devops/devops-lesson-3.git`  
`cd devops-lesson-3/lab-3.1`  

Unpack zipped dump files

`cd test_db`  
`gunzip *gz`  
`cd ..`  
`chmod +x *`  


### Step 3

Initialize directory structure

Carry out the following steps to set up the directory for the lab.

Create a Docker data volume to hold the database.

`docker volume create --name mysql_data`  

Confirm that the data volume was created.

`docker volume ls`  

List the contents of the directory 'test_db' and notice that it contains sample data for this exercise.

`ls -l test_db`  

Pull down the MySQL image for release 5.7 from Docker Hub.

`docker pull mysql:5.7` 

Examine the script that will run and create the student database structure.

`cat runserver_first`  

Run the script to create a container with MySQL running and create the database.

`./runserver_first`  

You will need to monitor the logs to see when MySQL has completed creating
the student database and is waiting for connections. This may take several minutes
to complete.

`docker logs mysql`  

When you see the following in the logs you may continue. Run the command until you see.

`mysqld: ready for connections.`  

Run the script to run MySQL in a container and mount the data volume.

`./runserver`  

Examine the logs from MySQL and wait for it to be ready to accept connections.

`docker logs mysql`  

### Step 4

Load data into the student database

Examine the script that will run the MySQL client. Notice that we are using the same image.

`cat runclient`  

Run the MySQL client container

`./runclient`  

You will be placed inside the client container running the Bash command shell.
You can now type commands to use the database

`mysql -h 172.17.0.2 -u student -p student`  

You will be prompted for the password. Enter 'student' as the password  
`Enter password:`  

When you connect you will see the MySQL client prompt  
`mysql>`  

At the prompt read in the definition for the employee information
Be patient! this will take several minutes to complete  
`mysql> source /data/employees.sql;`  

### Step 5

Examine the database tables in the database by selecting the first 10 rows from each

`mysql> show tables;`  

Observe the following output

`+----------------------+  
| Tables_in_student    |  
+----------------------+  
| current_dept_emp     |  
| departments          |  
| dept_emp             |

| salaries             |  
| titles               |  
+----------------------+  
8 rows in set (0.00 sec)`  

Get the first 10 records from the current employee department table.

`mysql> select * from current_dept_emp limit 10;`  

Observe the following output:

`+--------+---------+------------+------------+  
| emp_no | dept_no | from_date  | to_date    |  
+--------+---------+------------+------------+  
|  10001 | d005    | 1986-06-26 | 9999-01-01 |

### Step 4

Answer business questions with SQL queries

Q1. Who is the oldest employee and what is their age?

`SELECT first_name, last_name, TIMESTAMPDIFF(YEAR,birth_date,CURDATE()) AS age FROM employees ORDER BY birth_date DESC limit 1;`  

Q2. Which department has the most employees?

`select dept_no, count(*) AS number  from dept_emp WHERE to_date='9999-01-01' group by dept_no order by number DESC limit 1;`  

Q3. Which employee has the highest salary and how much is it

`SELECT t1.first_name, t1.last_name, t2.salary FROM employees AS t1 INNER JOIN salaries as t2 on t1.emp_no = t2.emp_no ORDER BY salary DESC limit 1;`  


Q4. Which employee manages the smallest department and how many employees are in that department?

See if you can answer this one yourself.

### Step 5
 
Clean up after the lab

 Exit from the MySQL client  
`mysql> quit;`  

 Exit from the client container  
 `exit`  

 Clean up the lab artifacts  
 `./cleanup`
